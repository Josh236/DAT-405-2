I first started off with finding a website where that I was interested enough in, to take data from it and use it in my own way.
This landed me on a weather website where the API key was free, all one had to do was sign up and one was sent to their email
address so they could use the information available.  To access the information, I used control.log(data) to see whether the data was
actually being received and I could also use that to see the paths I needed to use to access the relevant data.  In my case, I didn't
have to jump through too many hoops, there were only 3 paths.  After accessing the data I needed, I proceeded to draw it to the
canvas of the webpage so I could see how it would be displayed to the user.  This is when I started to think about how I would change
the user interface to make it more aesthetically pleasing, rather than just a lines of data that were incomprehensible. Splitting up
the data, naming them and making them have some sort of affect on the screen was my next priority.  I landed on the idea that I would
use the air pressure value as the main variable in how the webpage looked, simply because it was an easier number to work with- rather
than Carbon Monoxide PPM which had a letter on the end.  My first idea was to do air pollution for CO, but as I mentioned before; there
was a letter on the end of the number and I couldn't use as a float variable.
